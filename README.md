# Hardware Upgrades for the Rockwell JawStand

## Introduction

The Rockwell JawStand, available at Lowe's and elsewhere, is a very handy piece of gear.
It's intended as a general shop workholding clamp or stand, with a clamp that opens up to about 1.5" (enough to hold a 2x4), and a tilt mechanism that allows a full 90 degree rotation of the clamp from horizontal to vertical.

In addition to its intended use in woodworking, the JawStand has found other specialty uses, notably as a launch stand for large model rockets, where the tilt mechanism allows bringing the 1010 launch rail down to a horizontal position for loading taller rockets.  In this application, the JawStand gets exposed to outdoor conditions for days at a time, rain and condensation, corrosive rocket exhaust, and direct sunlight/UV.

## Goals

Because of its construction with fairly low-grade steel and hardware, the JawStand does not hold up well in outdoor use.  This project was motivated by having to throw out a 10 year old JawStand based launcher that had seriously corroded hardware, brittle plastic parts, and moderately corroded metal in the clamp frame that was making the tilt adjustment difficult.

## Fastener Upgrades

The most effective and simple upgrade is to replace all the fasteners in the JawStand with stainless steel equivalents.  This should noticeably extend the life of the unit.

All of the hardware is metric.  There is one part for which I could not find an 8-18 or 304 stainless version on McMaster - the M6x50mm carriage bolt.  For this one part I had to settle for a yellow plated corrosion-resistant regular steel bolt.

For M6 washers, you can substitute SAE 1/4" washers since the central hole is about 0.35 mm larger than the M6, and the outer diameter doesn't matter much.  Likewise the metric sheet metal screws are much more expensive than SAE ones in the USA, so I've listed SAE equivalents that work and will thread into the existing holes.

### Bill of Materials

All are 18-8 stainless steel unless noted.
