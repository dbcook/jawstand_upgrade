# Instructions for Rockwell JawStand Upgrades

## Stainless Steel Fasteners

There is nothing fancy about this - just replace all of the fasteners with equivalent non-corroding hardware given in the parts list.

If you still have the original plastic cushion blocks on the inside of the jaws, be careful not to over-tighten the screws.  It is very easy to break them after they are several years old.  I suggest replacing them with better ones; see below.

The original leg pivots are flange bolts used without a washer.  I substituted regular hex head bolts with washers because metric stainless flange bolts are hard to get in the USA, and the washers will protect the painted leg surfaces from abrasion from rotation.

The threaded inserts for the plastic knobs were originally very tall hex nuts - more like a threaded coupler.  Here I substituted regular hex nuts because finding
stainless parts matching the original height is difficult.  For a real upgrade you could turn your own aluminum or brass knobs on a mini lathe.
## Painting

### Clamp Screw Mechanism

I strongly recomment painting at least the two bent sheet metal parts that make up the main clamp mechanism.  They are unpainted from the factory and seem to corrode quite quickly, especially when exposed to model rocket exhaust.  This is most easily done while you have the clamp disassembled for installation of the stainless steel hardware.

* Give the parts a good wire brushing with an angle grinder.  You can use a Dremel tool to clean areas that the angle grinder brush wheel can't reach.
* Mask off the rubber pad on the larger part.
* Spray with a good self-etching primer - SEM or Dupli-Color.
* Color coat is optional.

### Jaw Frame

The jaw frame itself can benefit from improved paint, especially if you are using it as a rocket launcher.  The exhaust from larger composite propellant motors contains hydrochloric acid and is thus very corrosive.  Unfortunately the two stamped sides of the frame are welded together and can't be easily disassembled.  Here is what you can do:

* Remove the plastic rails along the sides of the jaws, and the main clamp assembly.
* Clean all surfaces well with a de-greaser like Simple Greene or Zep.  Use wipes on a stick to get at the hard-to-reach areas.
* Mask the sliding surfaces around the tilt arc.
* Spray a couple of coats of a good acrylic or epoxy paint.  It will be hard to get a uniform coating due to the welded-together frame, but do the best you can.

### Legs

You can also paint the legs if you wish, though they seem to hold up better than the other steel parts and don't really need it.

## Cushion Block Upgrade

The plastics used in the JawStand do not age well and become brittle over time.  The two small cushion blocks on the inside of the jaws are especially subject to breakage due to their insufficient size, mounting method, and the significant clamping forces.

You have a couple of options:

1. 3D print a plastic one in PETG.  You can just emulate the original simple shape, with nut holder recesses for two M4 hex nuts.  Use 100% infill for maximum strength.  Do not use plain PLA, it will not withstand outdoor or garage temperatures in the desert.  I would make the footprint of the plastic pad significantly larger than the original.
1. Make aluminum replacements.  All you need is a rectangle of 0.25" (6mm) 6061 with M4 clearance holes, counterbored to allow the M4 nuts to sit below the surface.  I am taking this route myself because aluminum pads will never break.  For a little cushioning, you can attach a rubber or plastic plate over the top of the aluminum.  Don't forget to make the counterbore large enough to get a nut driver over the nut.

## Anti-Corrosion Coating

The clamp assembly that locks the center spindle into the tripod consists of an M6 screw and and M6 nut welded to a flexible metal strap.  This can't be disassembled to replace the hardware with stainless items.  Fortunately it is fairly well protected inside the tripod head.  I used some machinery anti-corrosion spray (CRC 336, LPS, or similar) on this piece to help prevent rust.  You should also apply corrosion inhibitor around the tilt arc area that you didn't paint and to the central spindle that goes into the tripod.
