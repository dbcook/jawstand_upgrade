# Instructions for Rockwell JawStand Upgrades

## Stainless Steel Fasteners

There is nothing fancy about this - just replace all of the fasteners with equivalent non-corroding hardware given in the parts list.

If you still have the original plastic cushion blocks on the inside of the jaws, be careful not to over-tighten the screws.  It is very easy to break them after they are several years old.

## Painting

I strongly recomment painting at least the two bent sheet metal parts that make up the main clamp mechanism.  They are unpainted from the factory and seem to corrode quite quickly, especially when exposed to model rocket exhaust.  This is most easily done while you have the clamp disassembled for installation of the stainless steel hardware.

* Give the parts a good wire brushing with an angle grinder.  You can use a Dremel tool to clean areas that the angle grinder brush wheel can't reach.
* Mask off the rubber pad on the larger part.
* Spray with a good self-etching primer - SEM or Dupli-Color.
* Color coat is optional.

## Cushion Block Upgrade

The plastics used in the JawStand do not age well and become brittle over time.  The two small cushion blocks on the inside of the jaws are especially subject to breakage due to their insufficient size, mounting method, and the significant clamping forces.

You have a couple of options:

1. 3D print a plastic one in PETG.  You can just emulate the original simple shape, with nut holder recesses for two #4 hex nuts.  Use 100% infill for maximum strength.  Do not use plain PLA, it will not withstand outdoor or garage temperatures in the desert.  I would make the footprint of the plastic part significantly larger than the original.
1. Make aluminum replacements.  All you need is a rectangle of 0.25" (6mm) 6061 with M4 clearance holes, counterbored to allow the M4 nuts to sit below the surface.  I went this route because the metal pads will never break.  For a little cushioning, you can attach a rubber or plastic plate over the top of the aluminum.
